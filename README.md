My third project, trying to strike a balance between producing good work but not spending too long on a project where I am just trying to practise before I move onto the next lesson. 

Plan is to build a working etch a sketch that operates out of the web browser, with buttons to change colour, reset and change grid size. 

*Project now complete. 

Satisfied that it works to an acceptable standard, however there are a few things I'd do differently if I wanted to spend more time on the project. 

*Clear up code with regards to calling functions twice with clear(), but otherwise they don't seem to work when clearing grid. 
*For some reason clear position resets when pressing clear to left side of buttons. Can call the function again, but makes the button bug out.
*Would add a slider in future, so that I could adjust the grid that way rather than a prompt.
